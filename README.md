# my_jquery_game
This is my Jquery game 
#Technologies
bootstrap, animate.css (still learning how to use it), javascript, jquery, html, css, css reset sheet 

#about the file  
file oiginates with index.html for viewing in browser 
page one allows you to see character stats and images in card pulled from bootstrap, but added via javascript 
it was acrually easier to add them via javascript because I didn't have to create a card for every single character (yay for loops)

#gameplay
pick a character while divOne is open. Once a payer selects a character divOne empties and divTwo is shown. Div two is where the actual game play occurs. you can battle other characters the lonly way to actually lose is if you select freddy kreuger. that is designedo n purpose because I never liked him 

#there is no formal reset button 
i came accross location.reset() and honestly I think it's fantastic and for this type of game it makes total sense because there a rounds in the game, but because my page is 'twoish' pages it was hard for me to figureo ut a way to reset the page and log won rounds without change the entire game play at reload 

#things I'd like to add
music-- i saw alot of other people put in music and it would be cool
I'd like to get different sounds to play for ever character 
I'd like to do more in terms of animation because I think they make the page look alot livelier and more like a game I'd like to play
